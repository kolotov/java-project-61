## Project Overview

This game is a study project from the Hexlet education platform. 

"Brain Games" is a set of five console games, built on the principle of popular mobile apps for brain training.
Each game poses questions that require correct answers. After three correct answers, the game is considered completed. 
Incorrect answers end the game and suggest to retry it. 

The games are:
1. Calculator. Arithmetic expressions that need to be calculated.
2. Progression. Finding missing numbers in a sequence of numbers.
3. Determining an even number.
4. Identifying the greatest common divisor.
5. Determining a prime number.

## Educational Achievements
This project allowed me to immerse myself in the Java ecosystem, learn how to configure the working environment, 
and get acquainted with Checkstyle (a code quality analyzer and linter) and Gradle (a framework for automating project builds).
It helped me understand the differences between git and GitHub, 
work with external repositories, gain experience in building the architecture of a full-fledged application, 
and writing clean code.
